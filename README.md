# Android-Studio-Development---Christmas-Counter-With-Activities

## Description
This Application is a countdown to Chirstmas. While waiting for Christmas to arrive users can listen to carols, music and read Bible verses. People usallly get into the Christmas sprit early on and this is a good way to get you day started. Every morning you are greeted with a notification of a verse and image. User can also share Christmas cards through the app to your family and friends.
 


## Development
Christmas Counter and Activities– The project is created using JAVA in Android Studios. The user interface contains a main menu which leads to other sub layouts. I used buttons, images, text and more to develop an eye-pleasing design. On the programming side, I developed a countdown that ends on Christmas day and sends notifications every day using firebase. I have also developed a program that gives the user a new Bible verse every 30 seconds in the app and the widget. I have created a music player to listen to Christmas carols. Lastly, I also developed the ability to send Christmas Cards directly through the application to platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

## Features
✅ Add a Musicplayer (Carolls & Music)
